 # Introduction
 
My name is Kehinde Oloyede. I am a positive and solution-driven professional with a unique blend of analytical expertise, structured problem-solving abilities, and excellent communication skills. Through practical projects, including testing platforms like Quickteller, Printivo, and Techteenz and automating workflows for Kongaâ€™s e-commerce platform, I have developed strong skills in manual and automated testing.

I am proficient in tools like Selenium, JIRA, Postman API, and Java, I excel in designing and executing test cases, logging and managing defects, and implementing testing strategies within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). I also have experience integrating automated testing into CI/CD pipelines to enhance testing efficiency and reliability.

I am building my expertise through real-world projects and continuous learning, intending to secure a senior-level QA role within a few years. My focus is ensuring software reliability, functionality, and user satisfaction while contributing to continuous improvement in testing processes.
